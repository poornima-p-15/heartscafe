# Hearts Cafe Website

This is a front-end web project for a fictional cafe named "Hearts Cafe". The website is designed to simulate an elegant and user-friendly café interface with consistent 
layout elements across all pages. It includes pages for viewing the menu, booking tables, giving feedback, and contacting the café.

# Project Objective

The goal of this project is to apply core HTML and CSS skills to build a complete multi-page website with a responsive layout,
reusable navigation and footer, and structured, visually appealing content. This project focuses on both functionality and design.

# Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Google Fonts
- Flexbox for layout
- Simple media queries for responsiveness


# Features

# Common Layout

- Navigation bar and footer are consistent across all pages.
- Responsive design using media queries.
- Font and color themes aligned with a cozy cafe atmosphere.

# Individual Pages

- Home Page: Introductory page with welcoming design and visuals.
- Menu Page: Displays food and drink offerings in an organized layout.
- Book Table Page: Table reservation form with user-friendly styling.
- Feedback Page: Form for collecting customer feedback.
- Contact Page: Includes a Google Maps iframe, contact address, and mail link. A breadcrumb trail is also added for better navigation context.

# Responsive Design

Media queries have been used to improve the experience on smaller screens:
- Navigation and footer items stack vertically on narrow screens.
- Font sizes and layout margins adjust for readability.
- Embedded content like Google Maps resizes for mobile.

# Design Considerations

- Color palette includes deep maroon (#873030) and soft brown (#574144) to reflect a warm, cafe-like aesthetic.
- Font choices: "Poppins" for body content and "Playfair Display" for headings to create contrast and elegance.
- Minimalist design approach with emphasis on readability and user navigation.
